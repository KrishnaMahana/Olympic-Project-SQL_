# Olympic-Project-SQL_


In this project, I delved into the rich world of Olympic data, leveraging SQL to extract invaluable insights. By querying the dataset, I unearthed trends, patterns, and correlations that shed light on the evolution of the Olympics over time. Through careful analysis, I uncovered key metrics such as medal counts by country, athlete performance across different sports, and the impact of geopolitical events on participation.

Using SQL's powerful querying capabilities, I dissected the dataset to reveal nuanced narratives, from the dominance of certain nations in specific sports to the emergence of new contenders on the Olympic stage. By employing advanced SQL techniques, including joins, aggregations, and subqueries, I was able to distill complex information into actionable insights.
